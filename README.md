JS Content Manipulation - MTM1526
Submitted by Masayo Williams

## Introduction
This project is to build a website that loads dynamic contents based on the user input.  
The website consists of a header with a navbar, a content section where a user can change the output by a click of an icon.  
The three contents are about how any person can ccontribute to a better environment using green energy.

## Usage
Upon page load, the website outputs the first content by default.  
There are 3 icons identifying the different methods in which a person can use green energy.
The icon representing the currently displayed content is highlighted.
Cursor changes to a pointer at mouse-over, and click on the icon will highlight the selected icon, and the content area outputs the associated content.

## Future Development
The contents are currently included in JS as an array.  When scaling up, this data will be relocated to a database file and be accessed via JS.
